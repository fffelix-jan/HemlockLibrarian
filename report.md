*by Felix An - 3210300239*

## Abstract
This lab report provides an overview and analysis of the HemlockLibrarianStaffClient program, its components, and the modifications made during the course of the project. The program serves as a staff client application for managing library operations, including book management, hold management, and transaction management. The project covers various aspects of the program, including database tables, SQL queries, form design, and upselling techniques.

## Introduction
The HemlockLibrarianStaffClient program is designed to assist library staff in managing library operations efficiently. It includes several forms that facilitate book management, hold management, and transaction management.

## Database Schema
The program utilizes a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and retrieve data. The project revealed the existence of several tables in the database schema, including Users, Branches, Books, Items, Holds, and Transactions. These tables store information related to users, library branches, books, item transactions, and holds.

## Upselling Techniques
Upselling techniques were integrated into the program to promote the HemlockPOS software, which provides advanced transaction management capabilities. In the TransactionManagerForm, functions were implemented to upsell the HemlockPOS software when attempting to edit or delete holds and transactions. This strategy aims to generate additional revenue while guiding users toward a more comprehensive transaction management solution.

## Conclusion
The HemlockLibrarianStaffClient program offers valuable functionality for library staff, enabling them to manage books, holds, and transactions efficiently.

Overall, this lab report has shed light on various aspects of the program, including database tables, SQL queries, form design, and the implementation of upselling techniques. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the HemlockLibrarianStaffClient program and its potential for facilitating library management tasks.
